# PYTHON-QR-CODE-GENERATOR
This Python script generates QR codes for UPI (Unified Payments Interface) payments using the qrcode library. The user inputs their UPI ID, and the script generates UPI payment links for three popular payment apps: PhonePe, Google Pay, and Paytm. It then creates and displays QR codes for each of these payment links.
